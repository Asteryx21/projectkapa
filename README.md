## About this project

This project is designed to facilitate and streamline the efforts of a team of dedicated volunteers who are committed to cleaning up polluted areas. The app allows users to register and gain access to a variety of features and resources that will help them stay informed and engaged with the team's ongoing activities.

Users can explore the app to learn more about the team and their accomplishments, including past clean-up efforts and environmental impact. Additionally, the app offers an interactive quiz that focuses on the 3Rs mentality of Reuse, Reduce, and Recycle. The quiz is a fun and educational way to engage with environmental issues and learn more about sustainable living.

One of the core features of the app is a dynamic calendar that provides information about upcoming events and clean-up efforts. Users can easily view the calendar to see what's happening and indicate their interest in participating by clicking the "Interested" button.

The app also includes an interactive map that displays the locations of past clean-ups and other relevant information. Users can report polluted areas by clicking on the map and seeing all reported areas marked with a red marker. In contrast, the green markers indicate where the team has successfully completed clean-up efforts.

Finally, users can easily log in after registering to gain access to all those features.

Overall, this project is a powerful tool for anyone who wants to get involved with environmental activism and make a positive impact in their local community. Whether you're an experienced volunteer or just getting started, this app offers a wealth of resources and support to help you achieve your environmental goals.
